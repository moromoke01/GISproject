            <h2><u>About Geographical Information Retrieval System(GIRS)</u></h2>
            <p>A Geographic information retrieval system (GIRS) is a system designed to
capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of
geographical data. The acronym GIS is sometimes used for geographical
information science or geos partials information studies to refer to the
academic discipline or career of working with geographical information system.
In the simplest terms, GIRS is the merging of cartography, statistical analysis and
database technology.
<br><br>
A GIRS can be thought of as a system that digitally creates and “manipulates
“spatial areas that may be jurisdictional, purpose, or application-oriented.
Generally, a GIRS is custom-designed for an organization. Hence, a GIRS
developed for an application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose may not be
necessarily interoperable or compatible with a GIRS that has been developed
for some other application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose. What goes
beyond a GIRS is a spatial data infrastructure, a concept that has no such
restrictive boundaries.<br><br>
In a general sense, the term describes any information system that integrates
stores, edits, analyzes, shares, and displays geographic information for
informing decision making. In the case of decision making and this geographic
information (web based) system, tourists can make decisions as to which sites
they will or would like to visit within the state.<br>
A geographic information retrieval system can also be described a
technologically based system that provides precise details about a place; where
it is located, how to get there and what such a location or place has to offer. In
the case of web based geographic information system, in addition to providing
information about a place Or location it also sometimes gives a pictorial view
which enhances proper geographic description.</p>
